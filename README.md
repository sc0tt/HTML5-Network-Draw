HTML5-Network-Draw
==================

Live drawing app written with Canvas and websockets.

TODO
----
* More elegant way to transmit new drawings (currently the entire canvas element is base64'd and sent up to the server, then down to all clients)
* Rooms, using # as the room name (eg. http://site.com/mycustomroom)
* Save image every 5 minutes (Save as http://site.com/mycustomroom.png)
* More TBD
